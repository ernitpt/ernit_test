## 🚀 Deployment Protocol
- I deploy Cloud Functions and Firestore Rules MANUALLY.
- Provide specific `firebase deploy --only...` commands when infrastructure changes.

## 📝 Changelog Protocol
- After completing a task (bug fix, feature, refactor, etc.), ALWAYS run: `npm run log "type: message"`
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `refactor`, `style`, `docs`, `perf`, `test`.
- Example: `npm run log "feat: added new login screen"`
- This automatically updates `CHANGELOG.md` without consuming many tokens.

## 💎 Aesthetics & UX
  1. Use "Skeleton" loaders for all async data fetching.
  2. Implement "Glassmorphism" or "Neumorphism" where appropriate.
  3. Ensure all forms have inline validation and haptic-style visual feedback.
  4. Use professional typography (Inter, Geist, or SF Pro).
  5. Always implement with best UI/UX practices.
